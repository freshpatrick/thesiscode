Operation manual
First,the data set is placed in the data folder,We provide daily stock price data of four stocks of APPL MSFT TSA IBM from 1980/1/1 ~ 2024/7/31,Data fields contains open high low close volume five fields.In addition, the intraday 15-minute data of these four stocks is also provided, except for TSLA, the data time is 2010/6/29 ~ 2024/7/31, and the data time of the other four databases is 2000/1/1~2024/7/31 .The 15-minute stock price data set field also includes the closing open high low close volume five fields, and the Astock data set is also contained in the data folder,Therefore, there are 10 data sets in the data folder.

Second,The comparative methods of this paper are placed in the method folder.This folder contains two folders, namely 15 minute stock data and daily stock, the intraday 15-minute data of APPL, MSFT, TSA ,IBM applied in different methods are included in 15 minute stock data folder.The daily stock folder contains daily stock prices of APPL, MSFT, TSA, IBM, as well as StockQM and Astock datasets applied in different methods.The packages required by the code are in requirements.txt.
